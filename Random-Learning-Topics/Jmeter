How to record all

go to chrome and download all the requests
go to https://flood.io/har2jmx and convert HAR to JMX
open the file in Jmeter

-What is performance testing
     -Performance testing is all about creating a load and measuring the response time
     -two types of performance testing :
          -backend
          -the whole user experience

-note that adding a listener will impact the results of the test for huge number of users
-when you request to API or webpage,it doesn’t matter its same it still a HTTP request
     -however you can request other than HTPP like Soap request or use another plugin for you Jmeter
-Another good tool to test the load test blazemeeter:
     -5000 users,you’re not able to test it in your machine
     -with blazemeeter you can do that
-You can use Jmeter to test a Mobile app

-

Number of threreads :
     -is the maximum number of user you’re going to test with
Ramp-up period:
     -for example if the number of threads is 20 and the ramp- period is 40
     -then in over period of 40 second then ramp 20 users
loop count :
     -how many times going throw this test

-How accurate is using Jmeter
     -for example you hit the server with 2000 user or thread in single Jmeter machine
     -in this case the cpu usage is 100% and that makes the process slower
     -so if you don’t hit the 100% cpu usage then its accurate

-Assertions:
     -assertions allow you to add logic to what you expect to happened and if what you expect to happened didn’t happened then raise an error
     -This assertion could be base on the response time
     -this also could be base on the content of the response

-Remeber to all ways have cache manager on
     -You have ability to turn off the cache off so every request is a new request
-Constant throughout timer
     -gives a ability to limit number of hit per ex. minuets
     -In other words it will add a delay

-Latency:
     -how long took the first bite to respond

-There are two types of testing :
     -what is the breaking point of backend
     -mostly should design the test the way that real customer use the web

-Remember JM is calculating the exact time of loading the whole page



If controller :
     -you can add a simple logic like if the response was something
     -then do something
     -So only if its true then make the child request
