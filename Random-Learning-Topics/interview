Explain The RESTFul Web Service?
2 kinds
SOAP >> xml base
restfull web services




What is API testing :
A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. Representational state transfer (REST), which is used by browsers, can be thought of as the language of the Internet.


API allows two pieces of software to talk to each otehr


how do i test eventbase api:

Dropbox

   Author: kooshanfilm@hotmail.com
* Suppose that both Alice and Bob have have downloaded a file A.pdf from some website and that each therefore has an identical copy thereof. Suppose that both Alice and Bob store their copy in their Dropbox folder . Why does Dropbox only store one copy instead of two copies of that file on its servers? For simplicity, let's assume that Dropbox doesn't have redundant servers or backups more generally so that Dropbox's only choice is to store one or two copies.

Genral QA questions
1.There is a test automation running and fails 13%, say 2/7 times? How you will debug when there is no code change or test code change?


A:


check if test data is still relevant
if servers are responding in desired turnaround time
check logs for similar kind of errors
check if application was up ,the whole time
check if machines are behaving slower due to continuos runs and memory leaks
Look at the failures in the logs, in general, it will be the health of the server to be checked,


2.HTML:
consider the followig :
<a href="#some_text">My Link </a> where will this link go?


A: The link will scroll the page to an element with the ID gogole

whereas ID selectors are unique..


What are the advantages and disadvantages of External Style Sheets?
A: The biggest advantages of external style sheets are that they can be applied to multiple documents while being managed from a single style sheet. This keeps code DRY and improves efficiency and convenience.
The disadvantages are that it may decrease loading time in some situations. It may also not be practical if there are not enough styling conditions to justify an external sheet.







HTML

Why do i get a 405 Not Allowed error message when using 'action' in html?


<form action=“wwww.google.ca" method="POST" name="my_form">


The action attribute submits information to the server and is processed in the back end code which is handled by php or another programming language the front end code is just directing the destination. So without something configured and set up to receive and read the information the 405 error message will display.

Using the each method, iterate over the contact_list array. Assign each array item to the local variable contact in the block and print out the value of the name and phone_number keys.


contact_list = [
     {"name" => "Jason", "phone_number" => "123"},
     {"name" => "Nick", "phone_number" => "456"}
]


contact_list.each do |contact|
     puts contact["name"]
     puts contact["phone_number"]
end







Linked list

   Author: kooshanfilm@hotmail.com
write boundary test cases for whether a linked list is circular linked list or not?
Take a flag bit at each node and make it zero initially. While visiting each node make the flag bit as one if it is zero. If already flag bit found as one then loop exist that is circular list.
* Start from a given node and traverse the linked list. Validate for null or start node point condition while traversing the linkedlist . In case we find node->next = null at any time then LL is not circular in nature. In case we encounter starting node address again then it means it is circular LL.

1-Reversing the array :






2-Given an array say [0,1,2,3,5,6,7,11,12,14,20]
given a number say 5.

Now find the sum of elements which sum to 5

eg:2+3=5, 0+5=5 etc.
I guess the interviewer wanted all possible combinations eg 0+2+3=5, etc




0+1
0+2
0+3
