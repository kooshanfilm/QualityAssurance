Char and Varchar

Char: You specify the fixed length as part of the type definition: CHAR(10)

VARCHER:require you to specify the maximum possible length of a string that could be stored in that column VARCHAR(99)

when you create a table in SQL choose one column to be your primary key
for example with the users table :UserName or UserIDNumber
Also you can have a joint primary key >> which is the combination of two columns

INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE,DELETE



INSERT:
Skeleton of the Insert:
INSERT INTO
<table_name> (<columns>)
VALUES
(<values>)

Example:
INSERT INTO USERS (username,password,full name)
Values
(‘newman’,’USMAIL’,’newman’)

SELECT:
getting information from the table

SELECT column name
FROM <table>
WHERE <condition>
ORDER BY <column>

for example:
SELECT indium,fullname
FROM users

SELECT password
FROM users
WHERE idum < 12

SELECT *
FROM moms
WHERE username = ‘ jerry'

Now what if we need to have usernames and the user’s mother’s name

JOINS :

SELECT <COLUMNS>
FROM <TABLE>
JOIN <TABLE>
ON <PREDICATE> PREDICATE means the common column

SELECT USERS.FULLNAME,MOMS.MOTHER
FROM USERS
JOIN MOMS
USERS.USERNAME = MOMS.USERNAME


UPDATE: change the information in the table

UPDATE USERS
SET PASSWORD = ‘1234'
WHERE indium = 10

DELETE :

DELETE FROM USERS
WHERE USERNAME = ‘NEWMAN'


Data dype in SQL :

Date - numaric and text
